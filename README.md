# ember-cli-zuglet

Simplification.

## TODO

* data parsing from-to firestore
* store settle (reference loads, queues)
* primitives for query, load, .. based on destroyable-computed
* auth
* storage
* maybe something which resembles identity -- union of multiple queries as a computed property
* transaction

``` javascript
import observed, { observerFor, resolveObservers } from 'ember-cli-zuglet/less-experimental/observed';
```

``` javascript
import route from 'ember-cli-zuglet/less-experimental/route';
```

``` javascript
import models from 'ember-cli-zuglet/less-experimental/models';
```

``` javascript
import model from 'ember-cli-zuglet/less-experimental/model';
```

or

``` javascript
import {
  route,
  model,
  models,
  observed,
  observerFor,
  resolveObservers
} from 'ember-cli-zuglet/less-experimental';
```

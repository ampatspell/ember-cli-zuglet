# TODO

* messaging
* store restore hook
* GeoPoint for data
* data changed properties
* doc.isDirty based on data state
* doc.isEditing which makes data updates go to pristine is there is changed properties in data
* primitives for query, load, .. based on destroyable-computed (`{ immediate: true }`)
* maybe something which resembles identity -- union of multiple queries as a computed property
* transaction
* provide identity to queries. identity should also have `doc('id')` and similar
